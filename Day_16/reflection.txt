Little than a thousand million thoughts plauging my head constantly. They are inflicting in me, almost mercilessly, both excruciating mental and physical pain. Smirking onto my face that my suffocation, so far, mine been the efforts, intents, trials and tribulations mean a speck of indignified void. The stiffness in my neck, infuriatingly burning iris of my eyes, and a brain with throbbing headache. A brain that I dont want. I dont want to spill a word to none. As if it matters in the first place. 
What good is anything anyway? Which one should i overlook- my insignificant position in this universe or the infamously overlooked imbalance of this entire inferno of a universe, which so jokingly seem to be shoven down my 5mm wide throat. 
No i am not here to ask the why me question, or the why this sucks question, or if i cant should i just give up question, or when will it end question or can i end it all question. For now, all things seem pretty simple. I can sense condemning silence of find it yourself, like always. Nothing's stopping nothing. I can go silent too. End it. Here. Slit me apart. That's a better choice. No, in fact, the best choice I can make for myself. Call me selfish. You might not here, but I shall always agree from where I end up. Oh, am I really?
