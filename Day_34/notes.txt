# Databases explained SQL vs NoSQL

### **Module Introduction: Data Persistence and Databases**

### **Key Concepts**

- **Data Persistence**: The ability to store data beyond a temporary state, ensuring it survives beyond server restarts.
- **Temporary Memory vs. Persistent Storage**: When data is stored in variables, it is temporary and can be wiped when the server is refreshed. To make data permanent, databases are used.

### **Example:**

- When building an API, blog posts stored in variables are wiped after restarting the server. This is because the data is stored in temporary memory, which is not persistent.

### **History of Storage Devices:**

- **Old Storage**: A memory disk from a computer museum in Bletchley Park stored only **4 MB** of data.
- **Modern Storage**: Despite technological advancements, the fundamental principles of storing data remain similar, involving magnetic polarity for data storage.
